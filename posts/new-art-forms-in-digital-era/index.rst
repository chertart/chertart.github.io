.. slug: new-art-forms-in-digital-era

On the 3 of December First Russian Conference of Junior Researchers «Problems of modern humanitarian education through the eyes of youth» took place in Moscow State University of Design and Technology. I participated there with topic «New art forms in digital era».

The XX century is considered as the beginning of the digital era. Development of computer technologies led to a rapid development of digital art. A lot of novel art directions arised: digital literature, digital painting, photo impressionism, ASCII-graphics, pixel art, chiptune, demoscene. `Virtual museums`_, three-dimensional modeling and printing appeared. Art, physics, mathematics, programming and technologies are tightly interlaced with one another so it is very hard to distinguish them. Artist workplace is computer in increasing frequency.

The development of powerful personal computers has led to the promotion professional programs for graphics and design. The widespread distribution of available mobile devices with cameras allowed not only to take pictures, but immediately impose them predefined effects. Previously artistic change of pictures was carried out only by complex systems of optical filters.

The human brain adapts to the growing flow of information. This happens in various ways. For example, the improving «efficiency» of remembering: for the modern person it is easier to remember not the information itself, but the way it was found. This process affects perception of art work features.

Artworks translation to digital form leads to multiple problems. Сhange in the perception of the viewer at several levels: on the level of form and scale perception, on the level of colors perception and at the level of whole work detalization should be noted especially. Therefore artists need more and more powerful ways for influencing feeling. Copyright problem is also important for modern artists.

It is harder to find a masterpieces of human genius among the ocean of modern art objects. Most of them are only the reflection of technology, not an artistic images.
